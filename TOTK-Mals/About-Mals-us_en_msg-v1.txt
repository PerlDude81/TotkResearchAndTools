    msg_directory: Mals is split into the following directories:
	
        ActorMsg    
        ChallengeMsg
        EventFlowMsg
        LayoutMsg   
        LocationMsg 
        NpcTerrorMsg
        ShoutMsg    
        StaffRollMsg
        StaticMsg   
		
        Each one has a set of its own .msbt files

    file_name: This is the .msbt file with the ending .msbt removed

    entry_name: This is the entry in the .msbt, i.e. Talk_0051

    entry_name: This is the combination of the full text in the message entry, minus the control changes (i.e. text color, font, etc.)


Designed to make it easier to look up which .msbt file holds a particular text, either from an NPC, signboard, tip, etc.

This is helpful for seeing text in game, then looking up the message file. Alternatively used in conjunction with my event flows dump, in finding where a particular text or MessageId event is stored (Message IDs can be searced in the event data with the file_name and entry_name fields.


For example, seeing a mini-game with the text entries of:

    I don't believe this... How is a score like
    that even possible?!I've never seen anyone get so many in
    before! There's clearly way more to you
    Hylians than I thought.I still have a long way to go before I can
    achieve anything as good.You deserve a real reward for putting on
    such an incredible show. Take this!

Searching some strings from that text, we'll find a message entry in the this message spreadsheet like this:

    file_name: Basketball_MiniGame
    entry_name: Talk_0024

Searching the event spreadsheet, we can search for this parameter value:

	EventFlowMsg/Basketball_MiniGame:Talk_0024

Now we can draw a line from mini-game text in-game, to its message file, and then to its EventFlow.


Hope this is helpful. I know the fields are limited to the bare minimum. I'll look to adding more data as the parsing tools are developed further.
